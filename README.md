Description
===================
This block can be shown in every moodle course set to invisble. It helps teachers figure out why their students can not see their courses.
It is especially useful for the new boost theme as the course name is not greyed out anymore when set to not visible.

Installation
===================
Unzip the archive in your "moodle/block"-folder
